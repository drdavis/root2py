# root2py

`root2py` is a small Python library which reads ROOT objects for
plotting using matplotlib. `root2py` can also be used to simply
convert ROOT object properties to numpy arrays. This project is not
like `root_numpy`, because it does not deal with ROOT TTrees, it deals
with existing plot objects.

Dependencies

 * ROOT
