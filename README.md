# rootplotlib

`rootplotlib` is a small Python library which reads ROOT objects for
plotting using matplotlib. `rootplotlib` can also be used to simply
convert ROOT object properties to numpy arrays. This project is not
like `root_numpy`, because it does not deal with ROOT TTrees, it deals
with existing plot objects.

Dependencies
------------
 * ROOT
 * NumPy
 * matplotlib
